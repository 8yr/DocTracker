# DocTracker
This application is designed for document tracking using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. It helps users easily locate and retrieve documents stored in different boxes by scanning NFC tags attached to each box. By simply entering the box's UID, the app searches through the boxes until the matching one is found. This system provides a quick and efficient way to organize and access physical documents, reducing time and effort spent searching for them.

User puts the document UID and passes the device to the boxes
When the NFC is scanned and it doesn't match the desired box, it will play an error sound
